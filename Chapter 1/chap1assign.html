      <blockquote>
      Here is a little information about me: <br/>
      I'm Sarah Janaskie and I've been a resident of Charleston, SC all of my life.
      My parents came here about 22 years ago from Columbia, SC. I was homeschooled until
      10th grade and from there I went to Wando to finish out high school. I loved both
      homeschooling and public school and am grateful for the experiences I had.
      I love singing, writing, reading, creating, and most importantly, nurturing my
      relationship with God. I have 3 other siblings; Lydia(18), Philip(13), and Joseph(5).
      I've been able to travel to 32 states over the years thanks to homeschooling and absolutely
      love going to Disney World.
